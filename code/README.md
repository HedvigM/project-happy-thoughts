# The Project

In this project we build an app where you can post a message that's between 5-140 characters. There is also a heart function where you can like messages.

## The problem

This week I've had some problems with understanding how al the elements function together and how to use the fetches in the different elements. Right now i'm struggeling with the form and how to display the thought from the form right away at the list. Right now an empty area (where the thought should show) appears and only when i reload the page the thougt appears.

I also wanted to make the heart perfectly round, and change colors when clicked. Last but not least I wanted to make a count down for the characters if i had more time. This week i have struggeld a lot with time management and had to make the whole app on a day when i had to care of my infant baby.
