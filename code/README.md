# The Project

The assignment was to build a twitter-like app where you can post a message and like the messages shown in the list. To build the app i used react, props and my API i build in an project named: happy thoughts api.

## The problem

I implemented my own API in this project, but unfortunately i had some problems with the implementation. When you write a new message or click on the hearts you first have to reload the site to se the updated information. If i had more time i would love to fix that problem and also make it possible to write a username, so one can se who the message is from.

I would also love to do a more exiting design for the app. Maybe a light/ dark mode.
